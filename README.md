# CP - Training
This repository contains source codes for all of my solved problems in ACDLadders and Junior Training Sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18gmcp7yY2NEMQILp7LK5LdG-douHGIOUV1hNY0M5yro/edit?usp=sharing).
**ADDED** CSES Problem Set

# Inside Junior Training Sheet:
- Each difficulty will have their own folders, and each solution file will be named after the problem's name and problem code.
- Files named with problem name first before problem code are not inlcuded in the training sheet. Those are just problems I found interesting and just randomly solved.

# Inside ACDLadders:
- There will be subfolders for each rating bracket.
- Files will be named according to their CF name.

# Inside CSES
- These are problems solved alongside Competitive Programmer's Handbook by Antti Laaksonen.

All source codes are only in Python or C++. Java/JS implementations will be uploaded once I find the time to do so.
All problems will only be from CodeForces. Problems not from CodeForces will not be solved (except CSES Problems).
