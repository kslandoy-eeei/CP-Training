# Junior-Training-Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the problems in Junior Training Sheet found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18gmcp7yY2NEMQILp7LK5LdG-douHGIOUV1hNY0M5yro/edit?usp=sharing

Each difficulty will have their own folders, and each solution file will be named after the problem's name and problem code.
Files named with problem name first before problem code are not inlcuded in the training sheet. Those are just problems I found interesting and just randomly solved.

All problems will only be from CodeForces. Problems not from CodeForces will not be solved.
